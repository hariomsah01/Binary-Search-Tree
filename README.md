Implement the BinarySearchTree class. The BinarySearchTree class extends
the BinaryTree class. Both can be seen here https://web.njit.edu/~kapleau/teach/2019F/cs114/prj4.txt. Your assignment is to
implement all of the abstract methods of the BinaryTree class recursively. They are:

insert
iterator (non-recursive)
remove
search

You must submit a modified BinarySearchTree.java
file with your source code. Do not submit and do not modify
the BinaryTree.java or Main.java files.
